### Services & Database Choices

#### üë§ Authentication & User Accounts
- **Database Choice:** `Relational DB (PostgreSQL / MySQL)`
- Requires strong **ACID guarantees** for user records, password hashes, and session management.
- A simple schema with `JOIN` capabilities is sufficient.

---

#### üñºÔ∏è Profiles & Interests
- **Database Choice:** `Relational DB (PostgreSQL / MySQL)`
- Profile data (bio, interests, etc.) fits naturally into a normalized relational schema with many-to-many relationships (e.g., `user_interests`).
- Allows for easy enforcement of foreign-key constraints and efficient lookups via indexed joins.

---

#### üìç Real-Time Location & Route History
- **Database Choice:** `Geo-enabled relational store (PostgreSQL + PostGIS)` for Hot Data (last 30 days) + `Object Store (S3)` for Cold Data.
- **PostGIS** allows for efficient storage and querying of location points using specialized GiST indexes.
- An LRU/TTL-like logic is managed at the application level to move data from hot to cold storage.

---

#### ‚òï Places
- **Database Choice:** `PostGIS/PostgreSQL` + `Redis Cache`
- Query results for nearby places are cached in **Redis** to reduce database load.
- Can be populated with data from third-party APIs (e.g., Google Places) and stored locally in PostGIS.

---

#### üîí Privacy Settings & Data Exports/Deletes
- **Database Choice:** `Relational DB (PostgreSQL)`
- Privacy flags (`share_location`, `invisible_mode`) and data management requests are stored alongside user records.
- Relies on database features like cascade deletion to reliably handle data removal requests as required by GDPR.

---

#### üí¨ Direct Messaging (DMs / Chat)
- **Database Choice:** `NoSQL Wide-Column Store (Cassandra)`
- Optimized for **very high write throughput** and fast reads of recent messages in a conversation (fan-out reads).
- Horizontally scalable and partitioned by `conversation_id` to handle massive message volumes without complex joins.
- An LRU-like algorithm can be used at the application level to manage conversation history.
