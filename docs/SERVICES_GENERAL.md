### Services & Database Choices

#### üë§ [Authentication & User Accounts](auth/SERVICE_AUTH.md)

Responsible for user registration, login, and session management.

- **Database Choice:** `Relational DB (PostgreSQL / MySQL)`
- Requires strong **ACID guarantees** for user records, password hashes, and session management.
- A simple schema with `JOIN` capabilities is sufficient.

---

#### üñºÔ∏è [Profiles & Interests](profile/SERVICE_PROFILE.md)

Responsible for user profile management, including bio, interests, and photos.

- **Database Choice:** `Relational DB (PostgreSQL / MySQL)`
- Profile data (bio, interests, etc.) fits naturally into a normalized relational schema with many-to-many relationships (e.g., `user_interests`).
- Allows for easy enforcement of foreign-key constraints and efficient lookups via indexed joins.

---

#### üìç [Real-Time Location & Route History](location/SERVICE_LOCATION.md)

Handles real-time location updates, route history, and geospatial queries.

- **Database Choice:** `Geo-enabled relational store (PostgreSQL + PostGIS)` for Hot Data (last 30 days) + `Object Store (S3)` for Cold Data.
- **PostGIS** allows for efficient storage and querying of location points using specialized GiST indexes.
- An LRU/TTL-like logic is managed at the application level to move data from hot to cold storage.

---

#### ‚òï [Places](places/SERVICE_PLACES.md)

Manages a catalogue of places (e.g. coffee shops, galleries, restaurants, yoga studios, etc) with geospatial data.

- **Database Choice:** `PostGIS/PostgreSQL` + `Redis Cache`
- Query results for nearby places are cached in **Redis** to reduce database load.
- Can be populated with data from third-party APIs (e.g., Google Places) and stored locally in PostGIS.

---

#### üîí [Privacy Settings & Data Exports/Deletes](data-privacy/SERVICE_DATA_PRIVACY.md)

Manages user privacy settings, personalization & analytics consents and data export/delete requests.

- **Database Choice:** `Relational DB (PostgreSQL)`
- Privacy flags (`share_location`, `invisible_mode`) and data management requests are stored alongside user records.
- Relies on database features like cascade deletion to reliably handle data removal requests as required by GDPR.

---

#### üí¨ [Direct Messaging (DMs / Chat)](messages/SERVICE_MESSAGES.md)

Handles real-time direct messaging between users, including message history.

- **Database Choice:** `NoSQL Wide-Column Store (Cassandra)`
- Optimized for **very high write throughput** and fast reads of recent messages in a conversation (fan-out reads).
- Horizontally scalable and partitioned by `conversation_id` to handle massive message volumes without complex joins.
- An LRU-like algorithm can be used at the application level to manage conversation history.

---

#### ‚ù§Ô∏è [Matching & Recommendations](matches/SERVICE_MATCHES.md)

Responsible for finding and recommending users based on interests, location, and other criteria.

- **Database Choice:** `Search Engine (Elasticsearch)`
- Ideal for **full-text search** and complex queries on user profiles and interests.
- Supports **scoring** and **ranking** of matches based on user preferences and location proximity.
- Built-in replication and sharding capabilities allow for horizontal scaling as the user base grows.
- Can be integrated with a relational database for user data storage, using Elasticsearch as a secondary index for fast lookups.
- Supports complex queries like "find users with similar interests within 5 km".

#### üí≥ Monetization & Payment Transactions

Handles payment processing, subscription management, and transaction history.

- **Database Choice:** `Relational DB (PostgreSQL)`
- Financial transactions demand **strict consistency**, auditability, and easy reporting, making an ACID-compliant DB essential.
- A relational ledger table (e.g., with `transaction_id`, `user_id`, `amount`) is easy to index and join with user data for reporting.

---

#### ‚ö° Caching & Session Stores
- **Database Choice:** `In-Memory Key-Value Store (Redis)`
- Ideal for storing ephemeral, frequently accessed data with short TTLs (Time To Live).
- Example keys: `latest_location:<user_id>`, `matches:<user_id>`, `places:<geohash>:<category>`.
